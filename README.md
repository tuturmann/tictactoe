# tictactoe

Tictactoe game made in BASH on Linux. I made this project because I wanted to learn Bash and have fun with the language.
It's my first program in Bash, so the code might not be the best.
I initially coded the game in French so the variables remain in this language.
Some improvements would be not displaying the "x23x6o8x" after "I want to play : 9" every time, and making the display better.
